### 5. üöÄ npm-like Script Commands (Makefile)

Since UV doesn't support scripts like npm, we implemented comprehensive Makefile commands:

#### Test Commands:
```bash
make test                     # Run comprehensive framework tests
make test-unit               # Run unit tests only
make test-integration        # Run integration tests only
make test-e2e                # Run end-to-end tests
make test-coverage           # Run tests with coverage report
make test-fast               # Run tests with fail-fast mode
```

#### Kind + Playwright E2E Commands:
```bash
make test-kind-playwright             # Run Kind + Playwright E2E tests
make test-kind-playwright-all         # Run all tests with options
make test-kind-playwright-dashboard   # Run dashboard tests only
make test-kind-playwright-visual      # Run visual regression tests
make test-kind-playwright-debug       # Run tests with browser visible
make test-simple-e2e                  # Run simple standalone test
```

#### Development Commands:
```bash
make lint                    # Run ruff linting
make lint-fix                # Run ruff linting with auto-fix
make format                  # Format code with ruff
make typecheck               # Run mypy type checking
make security                # Run security checks with bandit
make pre-commit-install      # Install pre-commit hooks
make pre-commit-run          # Run pre-commit on all files
```

#### Setup Commands:
```bash
make setup-dev               # Setup complete development environment
make setup-all               # Setup environment with all extras
make install                 # Install framework with UV
make clean                   # Clean build artifacts and cache files
```

### 6. üèõÔ∏è Architecture Documentation
Added comprehensive architecture diagrams to `README.md`:

- **Overall Framework Architecture** - Shows all components and their relationships
- **E2E Testing Architecture** - Specific to Kind + Playwright infrastructure
- **Visual flow diagrams** using Mermaid showing:
  - Development tools layer
  - Testing infrastructure layer
  - Framework core layer
  - Service layer
  - Kubernetes infrastructure layer
  - Observability stack
  - DevOps and CI/CD integration

### 7. üìã Helper Scripts
- **`scripts/show_script_commands.sh`** - Displays all available commands
- **`make show-commands`** - Shows npm-like script summary
- **`make help`** - Shows all Makefile targets with descriptions

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### Comprehensive E2E Testing
- **Kind cluster management** - Automatic creation, configuration, cleanup
- **Service deployment** - Kubernetes manifests, health checking
- **Browser automation** - Playwright integration with multiple browsers
- **Visual regression** - Screenshot comparison and diff detection
- **Performance testing** - Response time measurement and analysis

### Developer Experience
- **Easy setup** - Single command environment setup
- **Multiple execution methods** - Makefile, UV, shell scripts, direct Python
- **Rich documentation** - Complete guides and examples
- **Error handling** - Graceful failure and cleanup
- **CI/CD ready** - GitHub Actions integration examples

### Enterprise-Grade Features
- **Scalability testing** - Load testing with multiple replicas
- **Security integration** - Works with framework security features
- **Observability** - Metrics and monitoring integration
- **Service mesh ready** - Istio/Linkerd compatibility

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Quick Start:
```bash
# Setup development environment
make setup-dev

# Run simple E2E test
make test-simple-e2e

# Run full Kind + Playwright tests
make test-kind-playwright

# Run tests in debug mode (browser visible)
make test-kind-playwright-debug
```

### Advanced Usage:
```bash
# Run specific test types
make test-kind-playwright-dashboard
make test-kind-playwright-visual

# Run with shell script for more options
./scripts/run_kind_playwright_e2e.sh --test-type visual --headless false

# Run demo
make demo-e2e
```

## üîß Alternative to UV Scripts

While UV doesn't support npm-like scripts in the current version (0.7.2), we've created a comprehensive Makefile that provides the same convenience:

- **`make <command>`** instead of **`npm run <script>`**
- **All common development tasks** covered
- **Consistent command interface** across the project
- **Help system** with descriptions
- **Organized by category** (test, dev, setup, etc.)

## ‚úÖ Final Status

‚úÖ **Complete Kind + Playwright E2E testing infrastructure**
‚úÖ **npm-like convenience commands via Makefile**
‚úÖ **Comprehensive documentation and examples**
‚úÖ **Architecture diagrams in README**
‚úÖ **Multiple execution methods**
‚úÖ **CI/CD ready**
‚úÖ **Enterprise-grade features**

The framework now has a complete, production-ready E2E testing solution with excellent developer experience!
