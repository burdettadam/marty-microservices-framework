# Resilience Framework Implementation Notes

## Overview

This document provides detailed implementation notes and design decisions for the enhanced resilience framework, particularly focusing on bulkheads and timeout management for external dependencies.

## Implementation Decisions

### 1. Bulkhead Pattern Architecture

**Design Decision: Dual Bulkhead Types**
- **Semaphore Bulkheads**: For I/O-bound operations (database calls, API requests, cache operations)
- **Thread Pool Bulkheads**: For CPU-bound operations (data processing, computations)

**Rationale:**
- Semaphores provide lightweight concurrency control without thread overhead
- Thread pools isolate CPU-intensive work from affecting I/O operations
- Different patterns suit different operation types and resource constraints

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Semaphore bulkhead for I/O operations
class SemaphoreBulkhead(BulkheadPool):
    def __init__(self, name: str, config: BulkheadConfig):
        self._semaphore = threading.Semaphore(config.max_concurrent)
        self._async_semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(config.max_concurrent)

# Thread pool bulkhead for CPU operations
class ThreadPoolBulkhead(BulkheadPool):
    def __init__(self, name: str, config: BulkheadConfig):
        self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=config.max_concurrent)
```

### 2. External Dependency Management

**Design Decision: Dependency-Specific Configuration**
- Each external dependency type has pre-configured defaults
- Centralized registration and management through `ExternalDependencyManager`
- Decorator-based usage for clean integration

**External Dependency Types:**
- **Database**: Conservative concurrency (10), medium timeout (10s), circuit breaker enabled
- **External API**: Moderate concurrency (15), longer timeout (15s), strict circuit breaker (3 failures)
- **Cache**: High concurrency (50), short timeout (2s), no circuit breaker
- **Message Queue**: Moderate concurrency (20), medium timeout (10s), circuit breaker enabled
- **File System**: Low concurrency (8), long timeout (30s), thread pool based

**Rationale:**
- Different dependency types have different failure characteristics
- Cache failures shouldn't circuit break the entire service
- Payment operations need stricter limits and faster failure detection
- File operations are naturally sequential and need thread isolation

### 3. Timeout Configuration Strategy

**Design Decision: Multi-Level Timeout Configuration**
- Global default timeouts for each dependency type
- Per-dependency override capabilities
- Adaptive timeout support (experimental)
- Circuit breaker integration timeouts

**Timeout Hierarchy:**
1. Operation-specific timeout (highest priority)
2. Dependency-specific timeout
3. Dependency type timeout
4. Global default timeout (lowest priority)

**Implementation:**
```python
@dataclass
class TimeoutConfig:
    default_timeout: float = 30.0
    database_timeout: float = 10.0
    api_call_timeout: float = 15.0
    cache_timeout: float = 2.0
    # ... other timeouts
```

### 4. Circuit Breaker Integration

**Design Decision: Optional Circuit Breaker per Bulkhead**
- Not all bulkheads need circuit breakers (e.g., cache operations)
- Configuration-driven enablement
- Shared circuit breaker state across bulkhead instances

**Integration Points:**
- Bulkhead configuration includes circuit breaker settings
- External dependency manager creates circuit breakers as needed
- Metrics collection includes both bulkhead and circuit breaker stats

### 5. Configuration Schema Design

**Design Decision: Hierarchical Configuration**
- Base configuration with common patterns
- Environment-specific overrides (development, testing, production)
- External dependency-specific configurations

**Configuration Structure:**
```yaml
resilience:
  timeouts: { ... }           # Global timeout settings
  circuit_breaker: { ... }    # Global circuit breaker defaults
  bulkheads: { ... }          # Bulkhead type configurations

external_dependencies:
  specific_service: { ... }   # Per-dependency overrides

development: { ... }          # Environment overrides
testing: { ... }
production: { ... }
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Memory Footprint
- Semaphore bulkheads have minimal memory overhead
- Thread pool bulkheads pre-allocate worker threads
- Circuit breakers maintain sliding window metrics
- Recommendation: Monitor memory usage in production

### 2. CPU Overhead
- Semaphore operations are O(1)
- Thread pool context switching overhead
- Metrics collection overhead
- Recommendation: Use semaphores for high-frequency operations

### 3. Network Resource Management
- Bulkheads prevent connection pool exhaustion
- Timeouts prevent hanging connections
- Circuit breakers reduce unnecessary network calls
- Recommendation: Configure bulkhead limits based on connection pool sizes

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Metrics Collection
- Bulkhead utilization and queue depth
- Circuit breaker state transitions
- Timeout frequencies and duration
- Success/failure rates per dependency

### 2. Health Checks
- Real-time dependency health status
- Bulkhead capacity utilization
- Circuit breaker state monitoring
- Alert thresholds for degraded performance

### 3. Debugging Support
- Request tracing through resilience patterns
- Detailed error logging with context
- Performance profiling integration

## Best Practices

### 1. Bulkhead Sizing
- **Database connections**: Match or slightly exceed connection pool size
- **API calls**: Consider rate limits and SLA requirements
- **Cache operations**: High concurrency for read-heavy workloads
- **CPU operations**: Match CPU core count

### 2. Timeout Configuration
- **Database**: 5-15 seconds depending on query complexity
- **External APIs**: 10-30 seconds based on SLA
- **Cache**: 1-3 seconds for fast access
- **File I/O**: 30-60 seconds for large operations

### 3. Circuit Breaker Tuning
- **Failure threshold**: 3-10 failures depending on criticality
- **Recovery timeout**: 30-120 seconds based on dependency recovery time
- **Success threshold**: 2-5 successful calls to close circuit

### 4. Error Handling
- Use specific exceptions for different failure types
- Implement fallback strategies for non-critical dependencies
- Log circuit breaker state changes
- Monitor and alert on bulkhead saturation

## Migration Guide

2. Replace direct dependency calls with decorated methods
3. Update configuration files with resilience settings
4. Add health check endpoints with resilience metrics

## Examples and Usage Patterns

### 1. Simple Database Call
```python
@database_call(dependency_name="user_db", operation_name="get_user")
async def get_user(user_id: str) -> dict:
    return await db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
```

### 2. Complex Business Operation
```python
@resilience_pattern(
    config=ResilienceConfig(
        timeout_seconds=30.0,
        retry_config=RetryConfig(max_attempts=3),
        circuit_breaker_config=CircuitBreakerConfig(failure_threshold=5),
    )
)
async def process_order(order_data: dict) -> dict:
    # Combines multiple resilient operations
    user = await get_user(order_data["user_id"])
    payment = await process_payment(order_data["payment"])
    await send_confirmation(user["email"])
    return {"order_id": generate_id(), "status": "completed"}
```

### 3. Service Initialization
```python
def setup_service():
    # Register all external dependencies
    register_database_dependency("user_db", max_concurrent=10)
    register_api_dependency("payment_gateway", max_concurrent=5)
    register_cache_dependency("session_cache", max_concurrent=50)

    logger.info("Resilience patterns initialized")
```

This implementation provides a robust, configurable, and observable resilience framework that scales from development to production environments while maintaining high performance and developer productivity.
