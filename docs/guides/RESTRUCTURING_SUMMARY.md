## Key Changes Made

### 1. Source Code Organization
- **Created `src/marty_msf/`**: All framework code now lives under a single, well-organized package
- **Consolidated modules**: framework/, security/, observability/, marty_cli/ → src/marty_msf/
- **Updated package configuration**: pyproject.toml now uses the new structure

### 2. Service Templates Reorganization
- **Created `services/`**: Centralized location for all service templates and examples
- **Categorized by type**: fastapi/, grpc/, hybrid/, shared/
- **Moved templates**: Combined templates/ and service/ directories

### 3. Examples Restructuring
- **Organized demos**: Individual service demos are now separated by concern
- **Centralized runners**: All demo management scripts in examples/demos/runner/
- **Added notebooks**: Prepared for future tutorial content

### 4. Operations & Deployment
- **Created `ops/`**: Single location for all operational concerns
- **Organized by function**: k8s/, service-mesh/, dashboards/, ci-cd/
- **Consolidated devops**: Moved from scattered locations

### 5. Documentation Cleanup
- **Structured docs**: guides/, architecture/, demos/ organization
- **Moved project docs**: All project-level documentation to docs/guides/
- **Updated README**: Comprehensive documentation of new structure

### 6. Development Tools
- **Created `tools/`**: Centralized development utilities
- **Organized scripts**: scripts/dev/ and scripts/tooling/ separation
- **Test organization**: tests/unit/, tests/integration/, tests/e2e/, tests/quality/

### 7. Runtime Files Management
- **Created `var/`**: Runtime files (logs, pids) now isolated and gitignored
- **Clean root**: Reduced clutter in project root directory

## Updated Configurations

### pyproject.toml Changes
```toml
# Old
packages = ["framework", "security", "observability"]

# New
packages = ["src"]

# Old
marty = "marty_cli:cli"

# New
marty = "marty_msf.cli:cli"
```

### Import Path Updates
All imports now use the new `marty_msf` package structure:
- `from marty_msf.framework import ...`
- `from marty_msf.cli import ...`
- `from marty_msf.security import ...`
- `from marty_msf.observability import ...`

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and logical grouping
2. **Better Navigation**: Intuitive directory structure for developers
3. **Standard Python Layout**: Follows Python packaging best practices with src/ layout
4. **Cleaner Root**: Reduced clutter in project root directory
5. **Organized Operations**: All deployment and ops concerns in one place
6. **Scalable**: Structure supports future growth and additional modules
7. **Professional**: Industry-standard project organization

## Migration Notes

- **Import Statements**: Any existing import statements need to be updated to use `marty_msf` package
- **Configuration Files**: Any configs referencing old paths need updating
- **Documentation**: Links and references to old file locations need updating
- **CI/CD**: Build and deployment scripts may need path adjustments

## Next Steps

1. Update any remaining import statements in the codebase
2. Update CI/CD pipelines to use new structure
3. Update any documentation that references old file paths
4. Test all functionality with new structure
5. Update any external tooling or scripts that reference old paths
