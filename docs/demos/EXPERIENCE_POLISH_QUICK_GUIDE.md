## 🔍 Key Features Demonstrated

### Message ID Tracking
Every request gets a unique correlation ID that flows through:
```
Customer Request → Petstore API → ML Service → Payment → Delivery
     |              |              |           |         |
   msg-001        msg-001        msg-001    msg-001   msg-001
```

### Customer Profiles
The demo includes realistic customer types:
- **Family Pet Seeker**: Experienced, high budget, wants dogs/cats
- **First-Time Owner**: Novice, low budget, wants small animals
- **Exotic Enthusiast**: Expert, high budget, wants reptiles/fish

### Error Scenarios
Built-in error injection simulates real-world failures:
- Payment gateway timeouts (30% chance)
- Inventory shortages (20% chance)
- ML service degradation (15% chance)
- Delivery scheduling conflicts (10% chance)

### Rich Console Output
Beautiful formatted output shows:
- ✅ Success indicators with timing
- ❌ Failure details with recovery actions
- 📊 Summary tables with performance metrics
- 🎯 Message correlation tracking

## 📊 Analytics Integration

The `--export-data` flag generates:

**journey_analytics.json** - For Grafana dashboards:
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "success_rate": 0.95,
    "total_duration_ms": 2847,
    "average_step_duration_ms": 355
  },
  "performance_metrics": {
    "p50_duration": 245,
    "p95_duration": 890,
    "p99_duration": 1200
  }
}
```

**journey_data.csv** - For Jupyter analysis:
```csv
step_id,name,success,duration_ms,correlation_id
health_check,Service Health Check,True,89,abc-123
ml_recommendations,AI Pet Recommendations,True,456,def-456
```
