# Marty Microservices Framework - Changelog

## October 2025 - Framework Modernization Complete

### Major Achievements

#### ✅ Legacy Code Migration & Cleanup
**Marty Chassis → Framework Migration**
- Successfully migrated all `marty_chassis` dependencies to `src/framework` architecture
- Updated service templates, test infrastructure, and API gateway patterns
- Created backward compatibility shims with deprecation warnings
- Established clear migration patterns for existing services
- Legacy `marty_chassis` code completely removed from repository

#### ✅ Project Restructuring
**New Organized Structure**
- Restructured project layout following modern Python package standards
- Moved all source code to `src/marty_msf/` for better organization
- Consolidated all service templates under `services/` directory
- Organized documentation under `docs/` with clear categorization
- Created dedicated `ops/` directory for operational concerns

#### ✅ External Connectors Decomposition
- Decomposed monolithic 1,388-line module into focused packages:
  - `enums.py` - Core connector types and data formats
  - `config.py` - Configuration classes
  - `base.py` - Abstract connector interface
  - `transformation.py` - Data transformation engine
  - `connectors/` - Specific connector implementations
- All legacy shim imports successfully migrated
- Comprehensive unit test coverage established

#### ✅ Deployment Strategies Decomposition
- Decomposed 1,510-line module into organized package structure
- All consumers updated to use package imports
- Legacy shim files removed after verification

#### ✅ Plugin Configuration Modernization
- Removed legacy `PluginContext.get_plugin_config_sync` method
- Removed deprecated `config.plugins` fallback pattern
- New `PluginConfigManager` provides async configuration management

### Infrastructure & Platform Enhancements

#### ✅ Enhanced Observability Implementation
- Standardized OpenTelemetry instrumentation across all service templates
- Enhanced correlation ID tracking with multi-dimensional context
- Environment-aware configuration with automatic sampling rates
- Default Grafana dashboards for service and plugin debugging
- Complete infrastructure stack with OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, and Prometheus

#### ✅ Service Mesh Integration
- First-class support for both Istio and Linkerd service meshes
- Comprehensive traffic management policies (circuit breakers, fault injection, retry policies)
- New CLI commands for service mesh installation and management
- Enhanced Kustomize overlays with service mesh configurations

#### ✅ Resilience Framework Implementation
- Standardized HTTP and Redis connection pooling with health monitoring
- Circuit breaker and bulkhead middleware integration with FastAPI
- Comprehensive load testing framework with realistic concurrency testing
- Plugin foundation with resilient infrastructure for all components

#### ✅ API Documentation & Contract Testing
- Unified API documentation system supporting REST and gRPC services
- Multiple output formats (HTML, Markdown, OpenAPI specs, Postman collections)
- Enhanced contract testing framework with gRPC support
- Consumer-driven contract testing with interactive creation tools
- Comprehensive CLI commands for API management and testing

### Framework Consolidation

#### ✅ Duplicate Implementation Cleanup
- Consolidated gRPC server implementations into `UnifiedGrpcServer`
- Removed deprecated `GRPCServiceFactory` and updated all templates
- Standardized database manager implementations
- Unified monitoring and observability components

#### ✅ Code Quality & Testing Enhancements
- SQL syntax fixes across all database initialization scripts
- Enhanced automated test conversion framework
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new components
- Code quality improvements with standardized patterns

### Consumer Impact

✅ **Clear Migration Path**: Working examples available for chassis → framework migration
✅ **Modern Templates**: All service templates use framework-first patterns
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing services continue working during transition
✅ **Test Coverage**: Framework components properly validated by test suite
✅ **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Unified CLI, better documentation, clearer patterns

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed**: All `marty_chassis` imports (use framework equivalents)
- **Removed**: Legacy `PluginContext.get_plugin_config_sync` method
- **Removed**: Deprecated `config.plugins` fallback pattern
- **Removed**: `GRPCServiceFactory` (use `UnifiedGrpcServer`)

### Migration Guide

For services still using legacy patterns:
1. Update imports from `marty_chassis` to `src.marty_msf.framework`
2. Replace `PluginContext.get_plugin_config_sync` with `PluginConfigManager`
3. Update gRPC services to use `UnifiedGrpcServer`
4. Follow examples in `services/` directory for modern patterns
