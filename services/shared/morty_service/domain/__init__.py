Domain layer for Morty service.

This layer contains the core business logic and domain models, independent of any external concerns.
It follows Domain-Driven Design principles and hexagonal architecture patterns.

Key principles:
- No dependencies on external frameworks or libraries
- Pure business logic without side effects
- Domain entities and value objects
- Domain services for complex business operations
- Domain events for loose coupling
