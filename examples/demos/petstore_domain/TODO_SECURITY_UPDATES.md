# TODO: Security Framework Updates

The following files in the PetStore domain examples need to be updated to use the Unified Security Framework:

## Files needing updates:

1. **`app/services/security_service.py`** - Partially updated but still has deprecated method references
2. **`app/middleware/security.py`** - Needs complete rewrite to use unified framework

## Recommended approach:

- Replace deprecated imports with unified framework imports
- Update class constructors to use `UnifiedSecurityFramework` instead of separate managers
- Replace authorization logic with unified framework authorization methods
- Update secret management to use unified framework (when available)

## Reference implementation:

See `app/services/security_service_unified.py` for an example of how to properly integrate with the unified framework.
