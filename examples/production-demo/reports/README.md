# Production Demo Reports

This directory contains reports and analysis from the production-quality demo runs.

## Report Types

### JSON Reports (`production_demo_results_*.json`)
Structured data containing:
- Service performance metrics
- Order processing results
- Load test statistics
- Detailed timing information
- Success/failure rates

### Text Output (`production_demo_output_*.txt`)
Complete console output including:
- Service health checks
- Order creation flows
- Load testing progress
- Real-time monitoring data

## Generated Metrics

The production demo tracks:
- **Response Times**: Service response latencies
- **Throughput**: Requests processed per second
- **Success Rates**: Percentage of successful operations
- **Service Integration**: Cross-service communication
- **Error Handling**: Failure scenarios and recovery

## Comparison with store-demo

Unlike the simplified store-demo, production-demo reports include:
- **Real Framework Integration**: Actual MMF components
- **Enterprise Patterns**: Repository, DDD, Event Sourcing
- **Full Observability**: Comprehensive tracing and metrics
- **Production Scenarios**: Load testing and error handling

## Usage

Reports are automatically generated when running:
```bash
python production_demo_runner.py
```
