# Framework Migration Changelog

## October 2025 - Legacy Code Cleanup Complete

### Migration Accomplishments

**Marty Chassis → Framework Migration**
- Successfully migrated all `marty_chassis` dependencies to `src/framework` architecture
- Updated service templates, test infrastructure, and API gateway patterns
- Created backward compatibility shims with deprecation warnings
- Established clear migration patterns for existing services

**External Connectors Decomposition**
- Decomposed monolithic 1,388-line module into focused packages:
  - `enums.py` - Core connector types and data formats
  - `config.py` - Configuration classes
  - `base.py` - Abstract connector interface
  - `transformation.py` - Data transformation engine
  - `connectors/` - Specific connector implementations
- All legacy shim imports successfully migrated
- Comprehensive unit test coverage established

**Deployment Strategies Decomposition**
- Decomposed 1,510-line module into organized package structure
- All consumers updated to use package imports
- Legacy shim files removed after verification

**Plugin Configuration Modernization**
- Removed legacy `PluginContext.get_plugin_config_sync` method
- Removed deprecated `config.plugins` fallback pattern
- New `PluginConfigManager` provides async configuration management

### Consumer Impact

✅ **Clear Migration Path**: Working examples available for chassis → framework migration
✅ **Modern Templates**: All service templates use framework-first patterns
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing services continue working during transition
✅ **Test Coverage**: Framework components properly validated by test suite

### Next Steps

For remaining legacy code removal:
1. Audit any remaining `marty_chassis` usage outside compatibility layer
2. Complete service-by-service migration using established patterns
3. Archive legacy code once all migrations complete
4. Update CI/CD to use framework patterns
