# Code Quality Enhancement Summary

## Objective
Added automated code quality checks to enforce complexity and length limits in the Marty Microservices Framework pre-commit hooks.

## Implementation

### 1. Created Comprehensive Code Quality Script
**File:** `scripts/check_code_quality.py`

**Features:**
- **Cyclomatic Complexity Check**: Uses radon to detect functions with complexity > 10 (grade C+)
- **File Length Check**: Warns about files > 500 lines
- **Function Length Check**: Warns about functions > 50 lines
- **Actionable Feedback**: Provides specific refactoring suggestions
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for various edge cases

### 2. Updated Pre-commit Configuration
**File:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

**Changes:**
- Fixed xenon repository URL from `PyCQA/xenon` to `rubik/xenon`
- Updated xenon version to latest `v0.9.3`
- Replaced complex inline bash script with clean Python script reference
- Added `code-quality-check` hook that runs on all Python files
- Excludes test directories, templates, and examples folders

### 3. Dependency Management
- Added `radon>=6.0.1` to development dependencies
- Ensures consistent complexity analysis across environments

## Current Quality Status (Updated)

### Large Files Detected (>500 lines)
**Recent Progress**: Following the shim-based decomposition, many previously large modules have been significantly reduced:

**Still Large (requiring attention):**
- `src/framework/security/hardening.py` (1480 lines) - **Requires decomposition**
- `src/framework/ml/intelligent_services.py` (1305 lines) - **Requires decomposition**
- `src/framework/performance/optimization.py` (1243 lines) - **Requires decomposition**
- `src/framework/deployment/infrastructure.py` (1232 lines) - **Requires decomposition**
- `src/framework/deployment/operators.py` (1212 lines) - **Requires decomposition**

**Successfully Decomposed (now shims):**
- ✅ `src/framework/mesh/orchestration.py` (reduced from 1315 → 20 lines)
- ✅ `src/framework/data/advanced_patterns.py` (reduced from 1344 → 22 lines)
- ✅ `src/framework/resilience/fault_tolerance.py` (reduced from 1311 → 24 lines)

### Shim-Based Architecture Progress
The framework now utilizes a shim-based architecture where large monolithic modules have been decomposed into:
- **Shim modules**: Lightweight re-export modules (~20-50 lines)
- **Component modules**: Focused, single-responsibility modules
- **Clear separation**: Better organization and maintainability

### Long Functions Detected (>50 lines)
With the decomposition, many long functions have been refactored. Current analysis shows significant improvement in function length distribution across the decomposed modules.

### Complexity Analysis
- ✅ **No high-complexity functions detected** (all functions < grade C)
- The existing codebase maintains good cyclomatic complexity

## Pre-commit Hook Integration

The quality checks now run automatically:
1. **On every commit** - Prevents new quality violations
2. **Fast feedback** - Developers get immediate warnings
3. **Non-blocking warnings** - File/function length issues warn but don't fail commits
4. **Blocking errors** - High complexity functions fail commits

## Usage

### Manual Testing
```bash
uv run python scripts/check_code_quality.py
```

### Pre-commit Integration
```bash
uv run pre-commit run code-quality-check
```

### Full Pre-commit Suite
```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Benefits

1. **Automated Quality Gates**: Catches quality issues before they enter the codebase
2. **Educational**: Provides specific guidance on how to improve code quality
3. **Maintainable**: Uses separate script instead of complex inline YAML
4. **Configurable**: Easy to adjust thresholds and add new checks
5. **Comprehensive**: Covers multiple dimensions of code quality

## Next Steps (Updated Priority)

Based on the current analysis and successful shim-based decomposition progress, the following files should be prioritized for decomposition:

**High Priority (>1200 lines):**
1. `src/framework/security/hardening.py` (1480 lines) - Security hardening configurations
2. `src/framework/ml/intelligent_services.py` (1305 lines) - ML service integrations
3. `src/framework/performance/optimization.py` (1243 lines) - Performance optimization tools
4. `src/framework/deployment/infrastructure.py` (1232 lines) - Infrastructure deployment
5. `src/framework/deployment/operators.py` (1212 lines) - Kubernetes operators

**Medium Priority (800-1200 lines):**
- Additional deployment and testing modules that can benefit from decomposition

**Recommended Decomposition Strategy:**
1. **Extract core interfaces** into separate files
2. **Create implementation modules** for specific functionality
3. **Convert to shim modules** that re-export from components
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** through careful re-exports

**Success Examples to Follow:**
- `mesh/orchestration.py`: Successfully reduced from 1315 → 20 lines
- `data/advanced_patterns.py`: Successfully reduced from 1344 → 22 lines
- `resilience/fault_tolerance.py`: Successfully reduced from 1311 → 24 lines

This builds on the proven shim-based decomposition approach and ensures future code maintains quality standards while improving maintainability.
