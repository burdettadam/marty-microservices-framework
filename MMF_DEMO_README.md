│  Order Service  │───▶│ Payment Service │───▶│Inventory Service│
│   Port: 8001    │    │   Port: 8002    │    │   Port: 8003    │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         └───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
                                 ▼
                    ┌─────────────────────────┐
                    │  Analytics Plugin       │
                    │  (Real-time Analysis)   │
                    └─────────────────────────┘
```

### Service Responsibilities

- **Order Service**: Orchestrates transactions, manages correlation IDs, handles rollbacks
- **Payment Service**: Processes payments with deliberate performance bottlenecks for analysis
- **Inventory Service**: Manages stock levels and reservations
- **Analytics Plugin**: Real-time transaction analysis, bottleneck detection, error tracking

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the Demo Environment

```bash
# Start all microservices
./start_demo.sh
```

This will:
- Start Order Service on port 8001
- Start Payment Service on port 8002 (with simulated bottlenecks)
- Start Inventory Service on port 8003
- Display service health status and endpoints

### 2. Run the Comprehensive Demo

```bash
# Execute the full demonstration
uv run mmf_demo_runner.py
```

This will run multiple test scenarios:
- **Baseline Performance Test**: Normal load, no errors
- **High Load Test**: Increased load with large orders (triggering payment delays)
- **Error Scenario Test**: 15% error rate to demonstrate error handling
- **Mixed Workload Test**: Realistic mixed scenario with errors and bottlenecks

### 3. Review Results

The demo generates a comprehensive report saved as `mmf_demo_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` containing:
- Load test summary with success rates and response times
- Performance analysis with bottleneck identification
- Error pattern analysis
- Actionable recommendations

### 4. Stop the Demo

```bash
# Stop all services and clean up
./stop_demo.sh
```

    ]
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Transaction Traceability

Every transaction receives a unique correlation ID that tracks the request across all services:

```
Correlation ID: TXN-20241220-123456-001
├── Order Service: Order creation started
├── Payment Service: Fraud check initiated
├── Payment Service: Bank API called
├── Inventory Service: Stock checked
├── Inventory Service: Stock reserved
└── Order Service: Transaction completed
```

### 2. Comprehensive Audit Logging

All services log structured audit events:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-12-20T12:34:56Z",
  "correlation_id": "TXN-20241220-123456-001",
  "service": "order-service",
  "event": "order_created",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "order_id": "ORD-456",
  "amount": 99.99,
  "audit_trail": "Order successfully created and payment processed"
}
```

### 3. Performance Bottleneck Simulation

The Payment Service includes deliberate bottlenecks to demonstrate analysis:

- **Fraud Check Delays**: Orders > $1000 trigger 500-1500ms delays
- **Bank API Simulation**: Random 100-800ms latency
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Real-time performance tracking

### 4. Plugin Architecture

The Analytics Plugin demonstrates MMF's extensibility:

```python
class TransactionAnalyticsPlugin(MMFPlugin):
    def process_event(self, event: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        # Real-time transaction analysis
        # Bottleneck detection
        # Error pattern tracking
        # Performance recommendations
```

### 5. Error Handling & Root Cause Analysis

The demo includes various error scenarios:
- Invalid order amounts (< 0)
- Network timeouts
- Service unavailability
- Payment processing failures

Each error is tracked with correlation IDs for complete traceability.

## 🔬 Advanced Analysis

### Bottleneck Identification

The analytics plugin automatically identifies services exceeding performance thresholds:

- **Healthy**: < 500ms average response time
- **Warning**: 500-1000ms average response time
- **Critical**: > 1000ms average response time

### Error Pattern Analysis

Common error patterns are tracked and analyzed:
- Error frequency by type
- Error rate trends
- Service-specific error patterns
- Root cause correlation

### Performance Recommendations

The system provides actionable insights:
- Scaling recommendations for slow services
- Error investigation priorities
- Performance optimization suggestions
