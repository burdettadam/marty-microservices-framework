# Marty Microservices Framework

**Feature overview.** Marty Microservices Framework (MMF) is designed to meet all of the core needs of a microservice-based system. It bundles an [API gateway](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework#features) for intelligent routing and load-balancing, [service discovery](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework#features) via Consul, and centralized [configuration management](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework#features) with hot-reload. Built-in [event streaming](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework#features) uses Kafka for asynchronous messaging, while [database integration](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework#features) provides multi-database support with connection pooling and [distributed caching](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework#features) via Redis. The framework offers [real-time metrics and profiling](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework#observability), with Prometheus, Grafana and Jaeger providing metrics, dashboards and distributed tracing. A rich [CLI and project scaffolding](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework#development-experience) system generates FastAPI, gRPC or hybrid services, manages dependencies and automates Docker/Kubernetes deployment. The [security module](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework#security) supplies JWT-based auth, OAuth2/OpenID Connect integration, rate limiting, DDoS protection, zero-trust components and certificate management. MMF also includes a comprehensive [test suite](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework#testing) (unit, integration and e2e), extensive [documentation and guides](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework/tree/main/docs), [operations templates](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework/tree/main/devops/kubernetes) for Kubernetes, service-mesh configs, dashboards and CI/CD pipelines, and [sample domain services](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework/tree/main/examples/demos/petstore_domain) such as order, payment and inventory to illustrate patterns. These features collectively aim to give plugin authors and service teams everything they need out of the box.

**Technical stack.** MMF is built with Python 3.10+, using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for HTTP endpoints and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) for high-performance RPC, and provides [Jinja-based templates](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework/tree/main/templates) for scaffolding new services. Service discovery uses [Consul](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs), while event-driven communication relies on [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/); data is persisted in multiple databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) with built-in connection pooling and augmented with a [Redis](https://redis.io/) cache. Observability is handled by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for metrics, [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for dashboards and [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) for distributed tracing, all running inside a local or cloud [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster. The framework’s CLI (based on [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/)) orchestrates code generation, dependency management, Docker builds and Kubernetes deployments, while the security layer integrates JWT and OAuth2/OIDC providers and includes rate-limiting and certificate management. Operations tooling includes [Kubernetes manifests](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework/tree/main/devops/kubernetes), [service-mesh configuration](https://github.com/burdettadam/marty-microservices-framework/tree/main/docs/architecture), monitoring dashboards and CI/CD pipelines. Together, this stack ensures that MMF can deliver the full set of microservices features listed above with minimal additional setup.
