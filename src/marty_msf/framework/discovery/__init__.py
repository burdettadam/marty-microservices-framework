Service Discovery & Load Balancing Framework

Enterprise-grade service discovery and load balancing framework providing
dynamic service registration, health monitoring, intelligent routing,
and adaptive load balancing strategies.

Key Components:
- Service Registry: Central registry for service instances with metadata
- Health Monitoring: Continuous health checks and availability tracking
- Load Balancing: Multiple algorithms (round-robin, weighted, least-connections, etc.)
- Service Discovery: Client-side and server-side discovery patterns
- Circuit Breaker Integration: Fault tolerance with circuit breaker patterns
- Dynamic Configuration: Runtime updates and adaptive behaviors
- Metrics & Monitoring: Comprehensive observability and performance tracking

Usage:
    from marty_msf.framework.discovery import ServiceRegistry, LoadBalancer, ServiceDiscovery
    from marty_msf.framework.discovery import ServiceInstance, HealthCheck, LoadBalancingStrategy

    # Create service registry
    registry = ServiceRegistry()

    # Register service instance
    instance = ServiceInstance(
        name="user-service",
        host="localhost",
        port=8080,
        health_check_url="/health"
    )
    await registry.register(instance)

    # Create load balancer
    load_balancer = LoadBalancer(
        strategy=LoadBalancingStrategy.ROUND_ROBIN,
        health_check_enabled=True
    )

    # Discover and route to services
    discovery = ServiceDiscovery(registry, load_balancer)
    target = await discovery.discover("user-service")
