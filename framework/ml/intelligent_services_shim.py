"""
AI/ML Integration and Intelligent Services for Marty Microservices Framework

This module provides comprehensive AI/ML integration capabilities including model serving,
feature stores, A/B testing, automated deployment pipelines, and intelligent recommendations.

This is now a shim module that re-exports components from their dedicated packages.
For new code, prefer importing directly from the component packages.
