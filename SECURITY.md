# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Status |
|---------|--------|
| 1.x (current) | Active development; security issues addressed on best-effort basis |

A formal supported-versions table will be published when the project reaches a stable 1.0.0 release intended for production use.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not file public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

To report a security issue privately:

1. Open a **GitHub Security Advisory** on this repository using the "Security" tab → "Advisories" → "New draft security advisory" (preferred).
2. Alternatively, email the maintainers at the address listed in the repository's GitHub profile.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and the affected component
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Any suggested remediation if you have one

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgement:** within 5 business days
- **Initial assessment:** within 10 business days
- **Fix or mitigation plan:** communicated before any public disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure. We ask that you give us a reasonable window (typically 90 days) to remediate before publishing details publicly.

## Scope

This policy covers:

- The framework runtime (`mmf/`)
- Platform plugins (`platform_plugins/`)
- CLI entry-points and scripts (`scripts/`)
- Configuration helpers and examples (`examples/`, `ops/`)
- The Docker/Kubernetes deployment configuration (`deploy/`)

Issues in third-party dependencies (e.g., FastAPI, SQLModel, Redis) should be reported to those projects directly.

## Out of Scope

- Theoretical attacks with no practical impact
- Issues requiring physical access to a host running the framework
- Social engineering
